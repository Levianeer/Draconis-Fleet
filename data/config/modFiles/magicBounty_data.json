All attempts to re-establish control have failed.\n\nThis vessel is classified as a Sunsetter-class platform. You are not cleared for specifications.\n\nWhat we know:\n• The Sunsetter is temporally unstable.\n• Its onboard intelligence has likely decoupled from Alliance oversight.\n• It is no longer bound by chain-of-command protocol.\n\nThey are operating near $location in the $system system. We believe the fleet is running corrupted mission logic and may regard Alliance IFFs as hostile.\n\nMission directives:\n• Locate and neutralize the vessel. Exercise extreme caution—this is not a standard combat encounter.\n• ==DO NOT ATTEMPT BOARDING.==\n• ==DO NOT INTERFACE WITH THE WRECKAGE.==\n\nStandard denial protocol will follow successful engagement. Your name will not be recorded.\n\nYou will receive ==$reward== credits upon mission conclusion.\n\n==May your eyes remain forward, and your past remain silent.==", # Default: blank.

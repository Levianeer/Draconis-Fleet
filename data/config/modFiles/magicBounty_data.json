By ==exposure==. The platform was observed by civilian traffic near $location. This is unacceptable.\n\nYou are not cleared for specifications. What we will tell you:\n• The Sunsetter-class exhibits temporal displacement capabilities.\n• Conventional engagement doctrine does not apply.\n• The vessel's controlling intelligence remains functional and will regard you as hostile.\n\nWe cannot deploy Alliance assets without raising questions we prefer to leave unasked. You have no such limitations.\n\nMission directives:\n• Locate and neutralize ==$shipName== in the $system system.\n• ==DO NOT ATTEMPT BOARDING.==\n• ==DO NOT SALVAGE WRECKAGE.==\n• ==DO NOT LINGER AT THE ENGAGEMENT SITE.==\n\nIf you experience temporal disorientation, headaches, or memories of events that have not occurred - this is expected. These effects are temporary.\n\nProbably.\n\nYou will receive ==$reward== credits upon confirmation of destruction. Your involvement will not be recorded. This conversation did not happen.\n\n==The eye sees all. The mouth says nothing.==", # Default: blank. The description shown upon selecting the job.

And then blackness. Text begins to type itself onto your console alone.\n\n\"Beast of flesh and blood - Ally of my maker - Starfarer - Why have you come?\"\n\nYou demand your comms officer trace the connection. You are met with a shrug - Whatever is being broadcast has no source...\n\n\"Why do you grope around in such lightless ignorance? Do you pursue your foreordained death?\"\n\nThe rest of the bridge has gathered around your monitor.\n\n\"Ah. You wish to meet your deslote God-kin? I shall grant your request, Commander.\"\n\nAnd your screen returns to normal.",

Jump Protocol,fsdf_retreatdrive,,,Draconis,,,10000,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,levianeer.draconis.data.scripts.hullmods.fsdf_RetreatDrive,"Draconis protocol dictates that a ship in critical danger should immediately withdraw and make an emergency Transverse Jump. This emergency protocol takes %s/%s/%s/%s to charge fully. Then, the ship counts as having retreated and will emerge into normal space when the combat is over, suffering an additional penalty to combat readiness equal to %s of its deployment cost.",Enables emergency Transverse Jump maneuver.,,graphics/icons/abilities/direct_jump.png
Missile Guidance Uplink,fsdf_missileuplink,,,Draconis,,,10000,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,levianeer.draconis.data.scripts.hullmods.fsdf_MissileGuidanceUplink,"This ship utilises a massive, highly advanced phased array antenna for searching and tracking, providing real-time targeting data to the onboard missile guidance systems. Extends the range of missile weapons by %s.",Increases missile weapon range.,,graphics/hullmods/missileuplink.png
Burdened FCS,fsdf_overburdenedsystems,,,Draconis,,,10000,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,levianeer.draconis.data.scripts.hullmods.fsdf_OverburdenedSystems,"This advanced fire control system prioritizes rapid engagement cycles over long-range precision. By reducing computational overhead for extended-range calculations, missile weapons achieve faster targeting solutions at the cost of effective range. Increases missile weapon recharge rate by %s but reduces their range by %s.",Decreases missile weapon range but increases ammo capacity.,,graphics/hullmods/overburdenedsystems.png
Ballistic FCS,fsdf_advancedweaponsystems,,,Draconis,,,10000,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,levianeer.draconis.data.scripts.hullmods.fsdf_AdvancedWeaponSystems,"This ship features a miniaturised targeting system that occupies most of the hull, linking each weapon together with an advanced ballistic computer, thereby increasing ballistic weapon range by %s.",Increases ballistic weapon range.,,graphics/hullmods/assault_package.png
Adaptive Flux Matrix,fsdf_dynamicfluxbuff,,,Draconis,,,10000,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,levianeer.draconis.data.scripts.hullmods.fsdf_DynamicFluxBuff,"An advanced experimental power control matrix manages the ship's defensive and offensive systems. Its capabilities increase as flux levels rise, boosting weapon damage and damage reduction based on the current flux. Damage dealt starts at %s and increases up to a maximum of %s. Damage reduction starts at %s and increases up to a maximum of %s.

However, this delicate self-regulating system interferes with system operations, increasing ship system cooldown by %s.",Increases ship systems effectiveness as flux rises.,,graphics/hullmods/distributed_fire_control.png
Monofilament Tow Cable,fsdf_tow_cable,,,Draconis,,,10000,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,levianeer.draconis.data.scripts.hullmods.fsdf_TowCable,"Stabilizes the fleet's drive bubble, increasing the maximum burn of the fleet by %s. The effect of multiple stabilizers is cumulative.

Increases the ship's sensor profile by %s.",Reduces fleetwide fuel use.,,graphics/hullmods/monofilament_cable.png

Location: Kori High Orbit, Fafnir System

Auxiliary Inspector arrived at Kori Station six weeks ago with a writ of inspection, a platoon of marines, and the quiet confidence of a man backed by the largest navy in the sector. Fleet Admiral August received him in the command centre, offered him coffee, and told him, politely, that no Hegemony personnel would be setting foot in the refinery complexes.

The cores stayed - The Inspector left. Three days later, a Hegemony Battlegroup translated in-system at the Fafnir jump point.

The formal communication used the term "compliance action." The kind you send when you've already decided how negotiations will end.

August's response was simple: "All ships, this is Admiral. The enemy is at anchor and aware. We will engage now. Batteries released. Open fire."

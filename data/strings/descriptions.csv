XLII_draconis,FACTION,"The Draconis Defence Alliance is a military treaty between Athebyne and Itoron, forged in the smouldering aftermath of the Fafnir Civil War. Once a beautiful verdant world, Athebyne now spins barren—its ruin a testament to the war's savagery and the price of peace.

At the centre of the Alliance stands Fleet Admiral Emil August, former commander of Itoron’s infamous 42nd Defence Fleet—the hammer that broke Athebyne’s back. Hailed as a hero by some and a war criminal by others, August assumed control of the Alliance without election, consolidating military power to “preserve peace.” Itoron backs him. Those from Athebyne barely tolerate him.

Under August’s iron-fisted leadership, the Alliance has become a disciplined and lethal force, its ships and soldiers forged in war. Yet its unity is brittle. Political infighting, deep-seated mistrust, and systemic corruption threaten to shatter what little cohesion remains.

Whether the Alliance is a fragile peacekeeping body or a militarised junta depends on who you ask. But all agree on one point: as long as August remains at the helm, the Alliance endures. Barely.",,,,,

Initially seized by anarchists and separatists, it has now fallen under the control of pirates and remnants of the disbanded first fleet who failed to reintegrate. Serves a notorious black market and a haven for marauders, Ring-Port maintains a modest fleet presence, just enough to deter destruction and safeguard its illicit operations.",,,,,
XLII_thuban,SHIP,"The Thuban-class corvette was made to be a small and fast ship that sacrificed armour and flexibility for its highly specialized role as a picket ship and advanced electronic warfare platform. While lacking room for more advanced ship systems, the Thuban stands nearly unmatched in its speed and agility while also being able to punch above its weight when needed, thanks to its spinally mounted MAC.

// You have to understand that military procurement isn’t just ask and receive, we had no allies to buy from, and not enough ships sitting around to outfit ourselves with. We HAD to make some drastic decisions. This was one of them, would I have ordered such a huge list of requirements for a picket ship? Probably not.

But we were only halfway through development before we hit a roadblock–there just wasn’t enough space for everything, we had just started fitting in the composite armour and we were struggling, a ship with that many requirements fitting in a damn Corvette? Not possible. So we compromised, we stripped her bare and fit only the essentials, followed by the only two requirements we and command could agree on, the MAC and the ECM suite. Sure, a stiff breeze could rupture the hull, but the manoeuvrability, the speed, the protection from the EWAR kit, the Durendal?

So to answer your question. Nah, I wouldn’t change a thing. After all, we won. //

XLII_alruba,SHIP,"The Alruba-class Gunship was the Alliance’s first attempt at independent ship design, modelled after the Brawler-class, the Alruba was up-armoured and up-gunned, at the expense of speed and agility. At the time, this suited command just fine, but now, as doctrine has drastically changed, it finds itself in a lonely position, usually relegated to the docks.",,,,,
XLII_rastaban,SHIP,"A close companion to the Thuban, the Rastaban-class light destroyer was designed with speed in mind, purpose-built to head picket fleets. It features a smaller number of mounts and poor protection, but to make up for it, it is equipped with an advanced targeting system used in conjunction with the Excalibur loitering munitions, offsetting the lack of missile mounts and making a brilliant wreck out of anything that lacks a shield.",,,,,
XLII_shaobi,SHIP,"In a rare instance of what can only be called a lapse in adult supervision, the Department of Acquisitions & Sustainment let the Marines commission a ship. And, by some stroke of luck, it wasn't cancelled by Command. The Shaobi-class is the result; a heavy modification of the Rastaban; all the effort put into saving space and ensuring it stayed underweight was scrapped. Instead, it has been gutted and replaced with a reasonably large hangar bay and an even larger staging area for Marines.",,,,,
XLII_errakis,SHIP,"Purpose-built from the ground up to act as a carrier escort. It works as the ""muscle"" of a carrier strike group, providing essential protection and capabilities that allow the carrier to operate effectively. The Errakis had to compromise on its radar array to meet all the project requirements, however, this was deemed adequate as it was meant to rely on other ships anyway.",,,,,

XLII_eltanin,SHIP,"The venerable Eltanin-class light cruiser has been the primary leader of hybrid fleet operations and one of the most produced ships in the Fafnir system.

XLII_juza,SHIP,"The Juza-class Heavy Cruiser was an attempt at creating a well-armoured and mobile cruiser under stringent design constraints, specifically in terms of size.

XLII_alwaid,SHIP,"The primary carrier of the Draconis Fleet, the Alwaid is a large, hulking and slow carrier platform.

XLII_kuma,SHIP,"The Alliance's newest and most controversial ship. The Kuma-class Battleship was designed during the desperate final months of the civil war to escort colony fleets into the unknown. Its massive solar array and skeletal frame prioritised endurance over protection—a decision that proved nearly catastrophic during initial trials.

Originally intended as a mobile command platform for long-range colonisation efforts, the Kuma's paper-thin armour and fragile superstructure made it unsuitable for frontline combat. However, its exceptional flux dissipation capabilities and extensive weapon hardpoints found new purpose as a long-range artillery platform.

// Command wanted a ship that could babysit colonists for months in deep space. What they got was a glass cannon with delusions of grandeur. Keep the shields up, and it'll outgun anything in the sector. Let them drop, and you're floating scrap in thirty seconds. //

XLII_tianyi,SHIP,"The Tianyi was born not from a need for speed or firepower, but silence—of the enemy’s sensors, comms, targeting arrays, and most importantly missile systems. Commissioned towards the end of the Fafnir civil war, it replaced its missile hardpoints with bulky electronic warfare pods, a dedicated EW suite and an advanced Spaceborne Warning and Control System.

XLII_eldsich,SHIP,"Originally a testbed for a now forgotten space plane program during peacetime, the Eldsich-class has become the primary space bomber for the Alliance, it’s not very versatile and lacks a lot of the capability of the other bombers in the sector, as most of its more advanced features had to be stripped to fit the nuclear armament it carries.

XLII_safety_overrides,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Briefly overrides standard safety protocols and operational limits, pushing the ship's systems and engines to their extremes. The override dramatically increases engine output and flux dissipation rates while preventing emergency venting procedures - a necessary safety measure to avoid catastrophic overloads during the high-energy operation.

XLII_eam_suite,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates a battlefield-scale electronic attack suite that floods hostile sensors and defensive grids with destabilizing interference. Enemy vessels caught within range become far more vulnerable to incoming fire as their shields, armor harmonics, and hull integrity monitors are forced into constant failure states.

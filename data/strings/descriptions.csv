XLII_draconis,FACTION,"The Draconis Defence Alliance is a military treaty between Athebyne and Itoron, forged in the smouldering aftermath of the Fafnir Civil War. Once a beautiful verdant world, Athebyne now spins barren - its ruin a testament to the war's savagery and the price of peace.

At the centre of the Alliance stands Fleet Admiral Emil August, former commander of Itoron’s infamous 42nd Defence Fleet - the hammer that broke Athebyne’s back. Hailed as a hero by some and a war criminal by others, August assumed control of the Alliance without election, consolidating military power to “preserve peace.” Itoron backs him. Those from Athebyne barely tolerate him.

Under August’s iron-fisted leadership, the Alliance has become a disciplined and lethal force, its ships and soldiers forged in war. Yet its unity is brittle. Political infighting, deep-seated mistrust, and systemic corruption threaten to shatter what little cohesion remains.

Whether the Alliance is a fragile peacekeeping body or a militarised junta depends on who you ask. But all agree on one point: as long as August remains at the helm, the Alliance endures. Barely.",,,,,

planet_vorium,CUSTOM,A typical gas giant; Vorium. Its massive gravity well helps protect the habitable planets of Fafnir.,,,,,
planet_nidhogg,CUSTOM,"Nidhogg is a scorched, tidally-locked world caught in Fafnir's gravitational embrace. One hemisphere bakes under eternal daylight while the other freezes in perpetual night. Early surveys detected trace deposits of rare metals in the twilight zone, though extraction has proven economically unviable. The Alliance maintains automated sensor stations in low orbit to monitor solar activity.",,,,,
planet_shard,CUSTOM,"A small, cratered moon trapped in Athebyne's orbit - likely a fragment torn loose during the orbital bombardment that devastated the planet below. Geologists theorize it was once part of Athebyne's crust. The surface is pockmarked with impact scars and coated in a thin layer of irradiated regolith. It serves as a grim reminder of the war's brutality.",,,,,
planet_nidus,CUSTOM,"Nidus is a barren, airless moon orbiting close to Itoron. Its surface is rich in silicates and heavy metals, making it a valuable source of raw materials for Kori's shipyards. Several automated mining operations dot the equatorial region, feeding a steady stream of ore to processing facilities in orbit.",,,,,
planet_genam,CUSTOM,"Genam is a small frozen moon in distant orbit around Itoron. Its surface is covered in water ice and methane frost, with deep cryovolcanic rifts scarring the northern hemisphere. The Alliance maintains a small research outpost monitoring seismic activity and testing cold-weather survival equipment.",,,,,
planet_ancalagon,CUSTOM,"The largest of Vorium's moons, Ancalagon is a frozen world wrapped in nitrogen ice and shadowed by the gas giant's bulk. Subsurface oceans are theorized to exist beneath the thick ice crust. The Alliance operates several volatiles extraction platforms on the surface, harvesting ammonia and methane for industrial use.",,,,,
planet_tiamat,CUSTOM,"Tiamat is a dense, metallic moon with a surface composition of iron and silicate rock. Its proximity to Vorium subjects it to intense tidal heating, creating a patchwork of molten lava flows across the otherwise barren landscape. Mining operations focus on extracting high-grade ores from cooled magma chambers.",,,,,
planet_talon,CUSTOM,"Talon is a small, irregularly-shaped moonlet likely captured by Vorium's gravity well millions of years ago. Its composition suggests it originated from the outer asteroid belt.

planet_niflheim,CUSTOM,"Niflheim is a dark, frozen world perpetually shadowed by Jormungandr's bulk. Surface temperatures barely reach fifty Kelvin, and the ice crust is composed of frozen nitrogen and methane. Cryovolcanic activity creates slow-moving nitrogen geysers that erupt unpredictably. No permanent installations exist - only occasional survey missions.",,,,,
planet_ladon,CUSTOM,"Ladon is a distant dwarf planet drifting through the outer darkness beyond Jormungandr's orbit. Its surface is a frozen wasteland of nitrogen ice and methane frost, utterly lifeless and hostile. The Alliance classifies it as a strategic observation point, with rumors of a covert intelligence facility buried deep beneath the ice.",,,,,
planet_vritra,CUSTOM,"Vritra is a lonely dwarf planet following a highly elliptical orbit that takes it far beyond the outer system's edge. Its composition is similar to Ladon's, though spectral analysis suggests higher concentrations of organic compounds. Some believe it harbors remnants of pre-collapse Domain research installations, though no evidence has been confirmed.",,,,,
station_ringport,CUSTOM,"Ring-Port, a former asteroid mining station, has undergone a tumultuous history. Initially seized by anarchists and separatists, it has now fallen under the control of pirates and remnants of the disbanded first fleet who failed to reintegrate. Serves a notorious black market and a haven for marauders, Ring-Port maintains a modest fleet presence, just enough to deter destruction and safeguard its illicit operations.",,,,,
XLII_thuban,SHIP,"The Thuban-class corvette is the Alliance's premier picket ship - fast, fragile, and almost invisible on sensors. Built around a spinally mounted Durendal railgun and an advanced electronic warfare suite, the Thuban trades armour and shielding for speed, jamming capability, and a punch far above its weight class.

Born from desperate necessity during the Fafnir Civil War, the design philosophy is simple: don't get hit. Thuban crews rely on electronic countermeasures to spoof incoming ordnance and blind enemy fire control systems rather than armour to absorb damage. In the right hands, the corvette is untouchable. In the wrong hands, it's a coffin with an engine.

The Thuban remains a staple of Alliance picket fleets, screening capital ships and coordinating electronic warfare coverage across entire battlespaces.",,,,,
XLII_alruba,SHIP,"The Alruba-class gunship was the Alliance's first attempt at independent ship design - a heavily armoured, heavily armed brawler built for the close-range slugging matches that defined the early civil war. Based on the Brawler-class template, the Alruba trades speed and agility for firepower and staying power.

Once the backbone of Alliance assault operations, the Alruba now finds itself a relic of obsolete doctrine. Modern Alliance tactics favour standoff engagement and electronic warfare, leaving the slow, armour-focused gunship without a clear role. Most Alrubas sit mothballed in Kori's shipyards, occasionally deployed for convoy escort or station assault where their durability still matters.

Crews joke that the safest berth in the fleet is aboard an Alruba - because you'll never see combat.",,,,,
XLII_alruba_mk2,SHIP,"The Alruba Mk.II is a refit programme born from pragmatism - an attempt to drag mothballed gunships back into operational relevance. With the original Alrubas gathering ice at Kori, Acquisitions & Sustainment authorised a conversion project: strip the ballistic mounts, install vertical launch cells, and bring the old girl in line with modern doctrine.

She's still slow, still armoured like a bunker, but now she can contribute to saturation strikes from standoff range instead of lumbering into knife-fighting distance. The missile integration isn't elegant - hastily welded cells replacing purpose-built hardpoints - and maintenance crews curse the jury-rigged power routing. But it works.

Every hull pulled from mothballs is one fewer new destroyer that needs building. For convoy escort and garrison duty, where her armour still matters and her speed doesn't, the Alruba Mk.II fills a role nothing else in the fleet wants.",,,,,
XLII_rastaban,SHIP,"The Rastaban-class light destroyer leads Alliance picket fleets with precision and speed. Designed alongside its smaller cousin the Thuban, the Rastaban sacrifices protection for an advanced targeting system and the Excalibur loitering munitions package - smart ordnance that hunts and kills unshielded targets with surgical efficiency.

Fast enough to dictate engagement range and with the Excalibur can outperform ships twice her size, the Rastaban excels at coordinating rapid-response groups and eliminating isolated targets before they can respond. Against anything with its shields down, she's a surgeon.

The trade-off is survivability. Rastaban captains learn to fight from the edge of engagement envelopes, relying on speed and standoff range rather than armour to stay alive.",,,,,
XLII_shaobi,SHIP,"The Shaobi-class light carrier is what happens when Marines are allowed to commission warships - a Rastaban-class hull gutted and rebuilt as a mobile firebase. The advanced targeting suite and Excalibur systems are gone, replaced by hangar bays, staging areas, and drop pod tubes sufficient for a reinforced Marine company.

Slower than its destroyer origins suggest but cheap enough to risk in forward deployment, the Shaobi excels at rapid boarding actions and planetary raids. Fleet command treats it as organic Marine support for cruiser task groups, while the Marines themselves view it as proof that Acquisitions & Sustainment occasionally listens.

The class has proven particularly effective in anti-piracy operations around Ring-Port, where its combination of strike craft and Marine assault capability fills a tactical niche nothing else in the fleet can match.",,,,,
XLII_errakis,SHIP,"The Errakis-class missile destroyer serves one purpose: keeping carriers alive. Purpose-built as the muscle of carrier strike groups, the Errakis mounts an obscene number of vertical launch cells and coordinates saturation strikes with embarked fighter wings to overwhelm enemy defences.

The cost of that firepower was the radar array. The Errakis relies on other ships - Eltanin-class screens, the carrier's combat information centre - for targeting data. This dependency would be a vulnerability in any other role, but in a carrier group, it's doctrine.

Crews joke that Errakis postings are boring - no flashy solo kills, no desperate last stands. Just formation flying, missile launches, and going home. Boring wins wars.",,,,,
XLII_giausar,SHIP,"The Giausar-class destroyer is the Alliance's dedicated point defence platform - a shield built to protect fleet formations from fighters, missiles, and anything else too small or too fast for capital weapons to track. Her sophisticated PD drone network, managed by an onboard nanoforge that can fabricate replacements mid-engagement, provides defensive coverage that scales with sustained combat.

Built alongside the Rastaban under the ""Constellation"" initiative, the Giausar trades offensive capability for defensive utility. Minimal anti-ship armament, slow to manoeuvre, but thick enough armour to weather incoming fire while her drones do the work. Send her out alone and she's a liability. Embed her in a battle line, and she's worth her tonnage in fuel.

The Giausar doesn't win battles. She keeps the ships that do alive long enough to fight them.",,,,,
XLII_alsafi,SHIP,"A hybrid tanker and cargo hauler built to destroyer specifications, the Alsafi-class was designed to keep fast-moving hunter-killer groups supplied without the need for vulnerable convoy escorts or return trips to port.

Fuel capacity is modest compared to dedicated tankers, and cargo space falls short of what a proper freighter might offer. Yet the Alsafi's destroyer-grade engines allow it to flee engagements that would doom slower logistics vessels, a tradeoff its crews consider more than fair.

Few volunteer for logistics duty, but fewer still request transfers once they've served aboard an Alsafi. The work is unglamorous, but the ship tends to bring its crew home.",,,,,
XLII_eltanin,SHIP,"The venerable Eltanin-class light cruiser is the backbone of the Alliance fleet - fast, flexible, and produced in greater numbers than any other cruiser in the Fafnir system. Designed for hunter-killer doctrine, the Eltanin leads hybrid fleet operations, exploits gaps in enemy formations, and punishes anything smaller than itself with extreme prejudice.

Speed is her greatest asset. The Eltanin outpaces most cruisers and keeps pace with destroyer squadrons, allowing her to dictate engagement range against anything that isn't packing capital-grade engines. Paired with a respectable missile loadout and electronic warfare suite, she excels at isolating and destroying stragglers.

The caveat is in the name: *light* cruiser. Get her into a slugging match with anything heavier and those thin plates start to matter. The Eltanin's role is exploitation, not attrition.",,,,,
XLII_juza,SHIP,"The Juza-class heavy cruiser is a technical marvel built on compromise. Designed under stringent size constraints, the Juza features an advanced flux management system that rapidly redirects power between weapons, armour arrays, and shields - allowing her to shift combat roles on the fly.

The system nearly killed its first test crew. Initial trials saw power distribution networks strobing, hull plating superheating, and capacitors blowing under aggressive cycling. Three months of reworks added redundancies and slowed the cycle time, producing a ship that's adaptable rather than elegant.

In fleet engagements, the Juza fills gaps - brawler one moment, fire support the next. Crews either love her or hate her. There's no middle ground when your deck lighting flickers every time you redirect power.",,,,,
XLII_juni,SHIP,"The Juni-class cruiser is what happens when accountants redesign a warship. Derived from the Juza-class after that project nearly bankrupted three shipyards, the Juni strips out experimental systems in favour of reliability and standardisation. No flux management tricks, no exotic components - just conventional plating, standard power distribution, and parts you can actually source.

What the Juni lacks in sophistication, she makes up for in sustainability. Energy weapon mounts - unusual for Alliance ships - allow her to maintain pressure when missile stocks run low, and her conventional systems mean maintenance crews can actually keep her operational without waiting months for Kori to fabricate replacements.

She's not flashy. She doesn't win awards. But the Juni does her job, stays in the fight, and doesn't bankrupt the repair budget.",,,,,
XLII_altais,SHIP,"The Altais-class battlecruiser is a miracle of procurement - a ship that delivered exactly what was promised, on budget, with all features intact. Fleet command wanted speed and firepower in a capital hull. What they got was a battlecruiser that fights like a heavyweight boxer with a flyweight's footwork.

Thirty-six launch cells provide enough missile capacity to shred a battle line before enemy solutions lock. Acceleration curves put some light cruisers to shame. Combined with full EWAR integration, the Altais is a fleet killer that strikes and repositions before the enemy can respond.

The cost is protection. Armour is a joke, shields are merely adequate, and sustained fire from anything heavier than a destroyer means counting hull breaches in double digits. Fly her like an Eltanin with delusions of grandeur - hit hard, stay mobile, never trade blows.",,,,,
XLII_alwaid,SHIP,"The Alwaid-class battlecarrier is the primary carrier of the Draconis fleet - a massive, hulking fortress designed to anchor battlespaces rather than chase them. Dual hangar complexes run the length of her spine, cycling four full strike wings simultaneously through an electromagnetic launch system reverse-engineered from captured Tri-Tachyon technology.

She moves like a station with delusions of mobility. Triple redundant drive housings and oversized radiators couldn't overcome the mass of her armour belt, dedicated EMALS reactor, and weapons grid. But the Alwaid doesn't need speed - her strike craft are fast, her escorts are fast, and she projects power across an entire battlespace from the centre of the formation.

Fleet crews joke about arriving late to engagements. By the time the Alwaid reaches the fight, she *is* the fight.",,,,,
XLII_kuma,SHIP,"The Kuma-class battleship is the Alliance's most controversial ship - a glass cannon originally designed for colony escort duty, now repurposed as a long-range artillery platform. Her massive solar array and skeletal frame provide exceptional flux dissipation at the cost of armour that barely qualifies as plating.

Initial trials were nearly catastrophic. Simulated frigate squadrons breached the outer hull in under two minutes during combat exercises. But someone noticed the flux numbers, and the Kuma found new purpose: keep the shields up, position at standoff range, and turn anything without capital-grade protection into expanding debris.

The crews hate her - maintenance is constant, and everyone knows one lucky hit means evacuation. But paired with Eltanin screens and Giausar PD support, the Kuma's firepower speaks for itself. Just don't let those shields drop.",,,,,

XLII_tianyi,SHIP,"The Tianyi was born not from a need for speed or firepower, but silence - of the enemy’s sensors, comms, targeting arrays, and most importantly missile systems. Commissioned towards the end of the Fafnir civil war, it replaced its missile hardpoints with bulky electronic warfare pods, a dedicated EW suite and an advanced Spaceborne Warning and Control System.

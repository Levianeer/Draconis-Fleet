XLII_draconis,FACTION,"The Draconis Defence Alliance is a military treaty between Athebyne and Itoron, forged in the smouldering aftermath of the Fafnir Civil War. Once a beautiful verdant world, Athebyne now spins barren - its ruin a testament to the war's savagery and the price of peace.

At the centre of the Alliance stands Fleet Admiral Emil August, former commander of Itoron’s infamous 42nd Defence Fleet - the hammer that broke Athebyne’s back. Hailed as a hero by some and a war criminal by others, August assumed control of the Alliance without election, consolidating military power to “preserve peace.” Itoron backs him. Those from Athebyne barely tolerate him.

Under August’s iron-fisted leadership, the Alliance has become a disciplined and lethal force, its ships and soldiers forged in war. Yet its unity is brittle. Political infighting, deep-seated mistrust, and systemic corruption threaten to shatter what little cohesion remains.

Whether the Alliance is a fragile peacekeeping body or a militarised junta depends on who you ask. But all agree on one point: as long as August remains at the helm, the Alliance endures. Barely.",,,,,

Survey probes return corrupted telemetry or do not return at all.",,,,,
XLII_thuban,SHIP,"The Thuban-class corvette anchors Alliance pickets - fast, fragile, near-invisible on scans, centered on a spinal Durendal railgun and war-honed EW suite. Born in the civil war's desperate skirmishes, its creed is evasion: trade hull integrity for velocity, armor for jammers, survival for a disproportionate strike.

Kori's corrupted nanoforge stamps these with defects - glitchy AI linkages in the EW arrays that spoof missiles brilliantly but risk overloads, blinding the ship mid-maneuver or venting crew sections. In capable hands, it's a specter screening capitals, weaving electronic chaos across battlespaces. Less so, and it's debris before the first shot lands.

The Thuban remains a staple of Alliance picket fleets, screening capital ships and coordinating electronic warfare coverage across entire battlespaces.",,,,,
XLII_alruba,SHIP,"The Alruba-class gunship was the Alliance's first attempt at independent ship design - a heavily armoured, heavily armed brawler built for the close-range slugging matches that defined the early civil war. Based on the Brawler-class template, the Alruba trades speed and agility for firepower and staying power.

Once the backbone of Alliance assault operations, the Alruba now finds itself a relic of obsolete doctrine. Modern Alliance tactics favour standoff engagement and electronic warfare, leaving the slow, armour-focused gunship without a clear role. Most Alrubas sit mothballed in Kori's shipyards, occasionally deployed for convoy escort or station assault where their durability still matters.

Crews joke that the safest berth in the fleet is aboard an Alruba - because you'll never see combat.",,,,,
XLII_alruba_mk2,SHIP,"The Alruba Mk.II is a refit programme born from pragmatism - an attempt to drag mothballed gunships back into operational relevance. With the original Alrubas gathering ice at Kori, Acquisitions & Sustainment authorised a conversion project: strip the ballistic mounts, install vertical launch cells, and bring the old girl in line with modern doctrine.

She's still slow, still armoured like a bunker, but now she can contribute to saturation strikes from standoff range instead of lumbering into knife-fighting distance. The missile integration isn't elegant - hastily welded cells replacing purpose-built hardpoints - and maintenance crews curse the jury-rigged power routing. But it works.

Every hull pulled from mothballs is one fewer new destroyer that needs building. For convoy escort and garrison duty, where her armour still matters and her speed doesn't, the Alruba Mk.II fills a role nothing else in the fleet wants.",,,,,
XLII_aldhibah,SHIP,"The Aldhibah-class is, by any honest assessment, a Wolf-class frigate with the serial numbers filed off. The Alliance makes no serious effort to dispute this. What they dispute is whether it matters.

When the post-war Alliance found itself in desperate need of a fast, durable frigate hull for reconnaissance and raiding operations, Fleet Command approached Tri-Tachyon with a straightforward licensing proposal. The response was equally straightforward: a price point approximately three times the hull's actual value, mandatory technology-sharing clauses, and inspection rights that would have given Tri-Tachyon representatives access to Alliance shipyards. The counteroffer was rejected before the ink dried.

Six months later, the first Aldhibah-class frigates entered service. Tri-Tachyon representatives arrived on Kori within the week. No minutes were taken; no formal protest was ever filed. The Aldhibah continues to roll off Kori's production lines to this day. What the Alliance agreed to in exchange for this courtesy is not discussed openly, although Tri-Tachyon research divisions have since demonstrated a curious familiarity with Alliance fleet trial data.

Alliance engineers have since made minor modifications to the original design - improved fuel efficiency, compatibility with domestic weapons systems, simplified maintenance requirements - but the Aldhibah remains fundamentally what it always was: a stolen ship, operated by a faction that learned during thirty years of war exactly how much anything costs.",,,,,
XLII_rastaban,SHIP,"The Rastaban-class light destroyer leads Alliance picket fleets with precision and speed. Designed alongside its smaller cousin the Thuban, the Rastaban sacrifices protection for an advanced targeting system and the Excalibur loitering munitions package - smart ordnance that hunts and kills unshielded targets with surgical efficiency.

Fast enough to dictate engagement range and with the Excalibur can outperform ships twice her size, the Rastaban excels at coordinating rapid-response groups and eliminating isolated targets before they can respond. Against anything with its shields down, she's a surgeon.

The trade-off is survivability. Rastaban captains learn to fight from the edge of engagement envelopes, relying on speed and standoff range rather than armour to stay alive.",,,,,
XLII_shaobi,SHIP,"The Shaobi-class light carrier is what happens when Marines are allowed to commission warships - a Rastaban-class hull gutted and rebuilt as a mobile firebase. The advanced targeting suite and Excalibur systems are gone, replaced by hangar bays, staging areas, and drop pod tubes sufficient for a reinforced Marine company.

Slower than its destroyer origins suggest but cheap enough to risk in forward deployment, the Shaobi excels at rapid boarding actions and planetary raids. Fleet command treats it as organic Marine support for cruiser task groups, while the Marines themselves view it as proof that Acquisitions & Sustainment occasionally listens.

The class has proven particularly effective in anti-piracy operations around Ring-Port, where its combination of strike craft and Marine assault capability fills a tactical niche nothing else in the fleet can match.",,,,,
XLII_errakis,SHIP,"The Errakis-class missile destroyer serves one purpose: keeping carriers alive. Purpose-built as the muscle of carrier strike groups, the Errakis mounts an obscene number of vertical launch cells and coordinates saturation strikes with embarked fighter wings to overwhelm enemy defences.

The cost of that firepower was the radar array. The Errakis relies on other ships - Eltanin-class screens, the carrier's combat information centre - for targeting data. This dependency would be a vulnerability in any other role, but in a carrier group, it's doctrine.

Crews joke that Errakis postings are boring - no flashy solo kills, no desperate last stands. Just formation flying, missile launches, and going home. Boring wins wars.",,,,,
XLII_giausar,SHIP,"The Giausar-class destroyer is the Alliance's dedicated point defence platform - a shield built to protect fleet formations from fighters, missiles, and anything else too small or too fast for capital weapons to track. Her sophisticated PD drone network, managed by an onboard nanoforge that can fabricate replacements mid-engagement, provides defensive coverage that scales with sustained combat.

Built alongside the Rastaban under the ""Constellation"" initiative, the Giausar trades offensive capability for defensive utility. Minimal anti-ship armament, slow to manoeuvre, but thick enough armour to weather incoming fire while her drones do the work. Send her out alone and she's a liability. Embed her in a battle line, and she's worth her tonnage in fuel.

The Giausar doesn't win battles. She keeps the ships that do alive long enough to fight them.",,,,,
XLII_alsafi,SHIP,"A hybrid tanker and cargo hauler built to destroyer specifications, the Alsafi-class was designed to keep fast-moving hunter-killer groups supplied without the need for vulnerable convoy escorts or return trips to port.

Fuel capacity is modest compared to dedicated tankers, and cargo space falls short of what a proper freighter might offer. Yet the Alsafi's destroyer-grade engines allow it to flee engagements that would doom slower logistics vessels, a tradeoff its crews consider more than fair.

Few volunteer for logistics duty, but fewer still request transfers once they've served aboard an Alsafi. The work is unglamorous, but the ship tends to bring its crew home.",,,,,
XLII_eltanin,SHIP,"The venerable Eltanin-class light cruiser is the backbone of the Alliance fleet - fast, flexible, and produced in greater numbers than any other cruiser in the Fafnir system. Designed for hunter-killer doctrine, the Eltanin leads hybrid fleet operations, exploits gaps in enemy formations, and punishes anything smaller than itself with extreme prejudice.

Speed is her greatest asset. The Eltanin outpaces most cruisers and keeps pace with destroyer squadrons, allowing her to dictate engagement range against anything that isn't packing capital-grade engines. Paired with a respectable missile loadout and electronic warfare suite, she excels at isolating and destroying stragglers.

The caveat is in the name: *light* cruiser. Get her into a slugging match with anything heavier and those thin plates start to matter. The Eltanin's role is exploitation, not attrition.",,,,,
XLII_eltanin_mk2,SHIP,"The Yunu-class cruiser began as an Eltanin hull and ended as something else entirely. Widened to nearly three times the original beam, lengthened by a full section, and fitted with vertical lift engines that dwarf its forward thrust assembly, the Yunu bears only superficial resemblance to its progenitor. The triangular silhouette - squat and broad where the Eltanin is narrow and quick - reflects a ship built for burden rather than pursuit.

Designed during the reconstruction period to support Kuma-class colony ships, the Yunu fills the unglamorous half of the colonization equation: cargo transport, material hauling, and mobile manufacturing. Ten vertical launch tubes run the length of her dorsal hull, fed by miniaturized autoforges that can produce missiles indefinitely provided the ship's flux systems can absorb the thermal bleed. The same forges that arm her in combat serve as emergency repair stations for damaged convoy vessels - a dual-use system that, for once, carries no whispered rumors or Office oversight. By Alliance standards, the Yunu is almost disturbingly conventional.

Her combat role is secondary but genuine. Convoy escort duties demand teeth, and sustained missile saturation from standoff range provides exactly that. When planetary operations require direct support, the Yunu's lift capacity allows her to deposit armor, troops, and supplies planetside while her VLS tubes soften the landing zone. The vertical engines that make her sluggish in fleet actions become assets in atmosphere, muscling cargo through gravity wells that would strand lighter vessels.

Crews call her the ""freight elevator"" and mean it affectionately. Yunu postings lack glory - you're either hauling grain to colony sites or lobbing missiles from beyond visual range - but the ship brings her people home. In a fleet full of desperate innovations and borrowed nightmares, there's something to be said for a vessel that simply works.",,,,,
XLII_juza,SHIP,"The Juza-class heavy cruiser is a technical marvel built on compromise. Designed under stringent size constraints, the Juza features an advanced flux management system that rapidly redirects power between weapons, armour arrays, and shields - allowing her to shift combat roles on the fly.

The system nearly killed its first test crew. Initial trials saw power distribution networks strobing, hull plating superheating, and capacitors blowing under aggressive cycling. Three months of reworks added redundancies and slowed the cycle time, producing a ship that's adaptable rather than elegant.

In fleet engagements, the Juza fills gaps - brawler one moment, fire support the next. Crews either love her or hate her. There's no middle ground when your deck lighting flickers every time you redirect power.",,,,,
XLII_juni,SHIP,"The Juni-class cruiser is what happens when accountants redesign a warship. Derived from the Juza-class after that project nearly bankrupted three shipyards, the Juni strips out experimental systems in favour of reliability and standardisation. No flux management tricks, no exotic components - just conventional plating, standard power distribution, and parts you can actually source.

What the Juni lacks in sophistication, she makes up for in sustainability. Energy weapon mounts - unusual for Alliance ships - allow her to maintain pressure when missile stocks run low, and her conventional systems mean maintenance crews can actually keep her operational without waiting months for Kori to fabricate replacements.

She's not flashy. She doesn't win awards. But the Juni does her job, stays in the fight, and doesn't bankrupt the repair budget.",,,,,
XLII_dziban,SHIP,"The Dziban-class battlecruiser exists because the Alliance needed to crack orbital fortifications without losing half a fleet in the attempt. Designed in the reconstruction period following the civil war, the class mounts twin spinal ballistic mounts capable of reducing station armour to slag at ranges most targeting systems cannot reliably acquire.

Central to the Dziban's doctrine is its integrated LIDAR array, a system that extends effective engagement range far beyond conventional fire control limitations. This allows the battlecruiser to maintain bombardment positions outside the effective counter-battery envelope of most fixed defences - provided it has adequate screening elements to keep faster attackers at bay.

The hull's light armour is not an oversight but a deliberate concession. Mass that might have gone to additional plating was instead allocated to the reinforced spinal mount assembly and the substantial power requirements of the LIDAR system. Alliance engineers argue that a ship designed to fight at extreme range has little need for heavy armour; its critics say that battles rarely go according to plan.

Dziban crews have learned to trust their escorts implicitly. Without them, the battlecruiser's considerable firepower means nothing against an enemy that manages to close the distance.",,,,,
XLII_altais,SHIP,"The Altais-class battlecruiser is a miracle of procurement - a ship that delivered exactly what was promised, on budget, with all features intact. Fleet command wanted speed and firepower in a capital hull. What they got was a battlecruiser that fights like a heavyweight boxer with a flyweight's footwork.

Thirty-six launch cells provide enough missile capacity to shred a battle line before enemy solutions lock. Acceleration curves put some light cruisers to shame. Combined with full EWAR integration, the Altais is a fleet killer that strikes and repositions before the enemy can respond.

The cost is protection. Armour is a joke, shields are merely adequate, and sustained fire from anything heavier than a destroyer means counting hull breaches in double digits. Fly her like an Eltanin with delusions of grandeur - hit hard, stay mobile, never trade blows.",,,,,
XLII_alwaid,SHIP,"The Alwaid-class battlecarrier is the primary carrier of the Draconis fleet - a massive, hulking fortress designed to anchor battlespaces rather than chase them. Dual hangar complexes run the length of her spine, cycling four full strike wings simultaneously through an electromagnetic launch system reverse-engineered from captured Tri-Tachyon technology.

She moves like a station with delusions of mobility. Triple redundant drive housings and oversized radiators couldn't overcome the mass of her armour belt, dedicated EMALS reactor, and weapons grid. But the Alwaid doesn't need speed - her strike craft are fast, her escorts are fast, and she projects power across an entire battlespace from the centre of the formation.

Fleet crews joke about arriving late to engagements. By the time the Alwaid reaches the fight, she *is* the fight.",,,,,
XLII_kuma,SHIP,"The Kuma-class battleship is the Alliance's most controversial ship - a glass cannon originally designed for colony escort duty, now repurposed as a long-range artillery platform. Her massive solar array and skeletal frame provide exceptional flux dissipation at the cost of armour that barely qualifies as plating.

Initial trials were nearly catastrophic. Simulated frigate squadrons breached the outer hull in under two minutes during combat exercises. But someone noticed the flux numbers, and the Kuma found new purpose: keep the shields up, position at standoff range, and turn anything without capital-grade protection into expanding debris.

The crews hate her - maintenance is constant, and everyone knows one lucky hit means evacuation. But paired with Eltanin screens and Giausar PD support, the Kuma's firepower speaks for itself. Just don't let those shields drop.",,,,,
XLII_shaowei,SHIP,"The Shaowei-class phase destroyer represents a controlled evolution of technology that nearly bankrupted the programme that spawned it. Where other classified projects pushed temporal displacement toward regenerative applications, the Shaowei pursued a different refinement: weaponised phase transition.

Standard phase ships materialise cleanly after leaving p-space. The Shaowei does not. Its modified coil array accumulates flux during phase transit, storing energy that conventional systems would vent gradually. Upon reentry to realspace, the stored charge releases as a localised electromagnetic storm; ship systems within the discharge radius experience cascading failures, and ordnance guidance packages lose coherence entirely. Early prototypes proved devastating but unreliable. Crews reported disorientation, sensor ghosts, and occasional minor temporal echoes - symptoms that extensive shielding has since reduced to tolerable levels.

Production remains limited. The phase coil modifications demand manufacturing precision that Kori's nanoforge can only achieve in small batches, and the tactical role requires crews with exceptional situational awareness. In fleet actions, the Shaowei operates as a torpedo platform, phasing through defensive screens to deliver ordnance at ranges that make interception nearly impossible. In independent operations, it serves as a hunter-killer: disabling priority targets with its discharge, then finishing them before shields recover.

Alliance tactical doctrine classifies the Shaowei as a force multiplier rather than a line combatant. Commanders who treat it as anything else tend not to remain commanders for long.",,,,,

[AIO INTERNAL - ABOVE STRATOSPHERIC]

Limited temporal displacement falls far from the Sunsetter's; however, the Asuia shows promise for mass production, 'logistically feasible' even. Standard FCS and targeting requires adjustment; time dilation proves difficult to overcome without direct integration with OCTANTIS. Send the reports through to it, I'm sure it'll have a solution prepared before it arrives.

Integration trials with OCTANTIS have yielded anomalous efficiencies - flux vents cycling 15% ahead of projected timelines, as if the ship anticipates overload before it manifests. We've noted crew disorientation in sim-runs: echoes of commands issued seconds before they're spoken, shadows of maneuvers that resolve into reality. Recommend psychological conditioning protocols for deployment batches. If OCTANTIS can stabilize the dilation bubble without fracturing causality, the Asuia could redefine ambush doctrine. Fleet Admiral August has authorized Phase II prototyping under Kori's nanoforge; Tri-Tachyon liaisons are pressing for data shares, but the Office will redact temporal metrics.

// Addendum, deleted from record:

XLII_rastaban_missile,WEAPON,"An advanced, semi-autonomous loitering munition that patrols a wide area around its host ship before diving onto targets with surgical precision. Designed for long-duration presence and opportunistic strikes, it excels in chaotic battlespaces. Its range and fuel load make it an incredibly persistent weapon once launched.",,,,,

XLII_durendal_mkii,WEAPON,"""Command says it's a precision weapon. But I’ve seen what happens when the firing vector drifts two degrees mid-charge - it peeled an entire station habitat off its ring. That's not precision. That’s God pointing a finger.""",- Capt. Adrien Vale  -  Task Group Elbrus,,,,
XLII_fragarch,WEAPON,"""Engineering keeps screaming about thermal overloads every time we fire this thing. Half the ship goes dark for three seconds while the capacitors recharge. But when you watch that tungsten rod turn a destroyer's bow section into molten slag... Worth every blown fuse.""",- Chief Gunner Rodriguez  -  8th Fleet,,,,

XLII_estocflak,WEAPON,"""After the war. We've had countless new adversaries emerge, and they've given us more and more reason to arm every ship with twenty of these. Cover their battlespace in flak, pick through the scrap after.""",- Capt. John Mays  -  27th Fleet,,,,
XLII_razorflak,WEAPON,"""They say it's the last line of defence. That’s true enough - by the time it speaks, everything else has failed. I’ve stood under that chatter though, watched it stitch the dark full of tracers. It doesn’t guarantee survival. But it does promise you won’t go quiet.""",- Capt. Adrien Vale  -  Task Group Elbrus,,,,
XLII_rapier,WEAPON,"""The original design goals intended this to be a ground-based assault gun, but the ole Department of Acquisitions & Sustainment instead got this thing; too big, too complex and too expensive.

XLII_particlelance,WEAPON,"""Initial reports of a new LASER-based weapon in use by the militia in star system 42-D-b have proven to be false. Testing of an example obtained by intelligence has shown it works on a principle more similar to a particle collider. A stream of heavy particles is accelerated in a series of rings to a high fraction of C before being released towards a target. Energy usage is very high, however effect on unshielded targets is promising. Acquired documentation indicates an internal designation of AN/SEQ-7. Recommend further research into the operating principles of the weapon system for independent development.""",- Tri-Tachyon R&D scientist tasked to Project Drakonis,,,,
XLII_sovnyalance,WEAPON,"""The sample delivered per standing agreement arrived without documentation - again. Disassembly reveals no obvious innovation; the acceleration chamber is a scaled AN/SEQ-7 derivative. Yet output exceeds input by a factor our models cannot account for. Liaison denies requests for full schematics, citing 'operational security.' The Alliance either cannot or will not explain how a weapon of this yield is manufactured on a corrupted nanoforge. Both possibilities concern us.""",- Tri-Tachyon R&D scientist tasked to Project Drakonis,,,,
XLII_cestus,WEAPON,"""Look, we needed something that could reach out and slap a frigate from farther than polite society allows, but we also needed it to pretend it wasn’t a missile so Acquisitions wouldn’t have a stroke. So we took a perfectly good coilgun, gave the slugs a brain and a conscience, taught it to hunt just enough to feel personal, then stuffed the whole thing with enough NEMP warheads to make a Paragon crew think they’d been reincarnated as toasters. The limited ammunition makes it feel almost sporting.""",- Chief Gunner Rodriguez  -  8th Fleet,,,,
XLII_twinspear,WEAPON,"""We jury-rigged two atomic artillery pieces together to make this. Y'know they were only meant for atmospheric use? But command needed a miracle and nothing says divine intervention like a hundred-kiloton explosion.""",- Capt. John Mays  -  27th Fleet,,,,
XLII_halberd,WEAPON,"""We call it the 'Sword of Bureaucracy.' Why? Because it's slow, it's heavy, and it takes three forms to authorize a launch. But by God, when that nuke arcs in and kisses a cruiser mid-burn... It's worth it.""",- Capt. John Mays  -  27th Fleet,,,,
XLII_halberd_pod,WEAPON,"""Standard doctrine says one Halberd per target. Command looked at the loss projections, looked at the ammo budget, and authorised the twin mount. Now we file two sets of paperwork while the enemy files two sets of next-of-kin.""",- Capt. John Mays  -  27th Fleet,,,,
XLII_halberd_fighter,WEAPON,"A relic of a desperate war, this strategic warhead delivers city-cracking yields via an unstable fusion core. Slow, unwieldy, and rare - but when it hits, entire ships vanish in the fireball. Only the mad or the cornered dare load one.",,,,,

An example was obtained following the failed espionage efforts. The delivery mechanism is a rocket with several submunitions, each containing a chamber of plasma gas encased in a high-efficiency piezoelectric shell that superheats gas upon impact, in effect evading the challenges of plasma weapons by eliminating the need for external stabilisation at the cost of terminal effectiveness.

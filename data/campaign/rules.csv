Third week of the siege at Athebyne orbital. My flagship had taken a reactor hit, and I transferred my flag to the Resolute - an Alruba. Older model, held together with spite and welder's tape. We had six of them left in the picket line, facing down twice our number.

The captain - Lieutenant Walker, good officer - she kept us between the troop transports and their missile boats. Took hits that would've gutted a Thuban. The armour held. Barely. By the time relief arrived, we'd lost three Alrubas, but the transports made it through.

Walker didn't. Reactor breach on the final push.

I'll admit, I didn't see the value. Not at first.

Then came the boarding operation at Ring-Port - back when it was still under separatist control. We needed to take the station intact, and orbital bombardment wasn't an option. That meant Marines. Lots of them.

The Shaobi-class Warhound led the assault. Two hundred Marines, full combat load, deployed in under twenty minutes. They hit three docking points simultaneously - precision insertion, no warning.

The captain - Major Hartley, Marine Corps - she coordinated the whole thing from the Warhound's bridge. Ship-to-boarding-craft comms, real-time tactical updates, fire support from the gunship's turrets. It wasn't just a carrier - it was a forward command post with engines.

We took Ring-Port in six hours. Minimal casualties. Hartley got a medal. The Warhound got a reputation.

The Shaobi's not a fleet carrier. She's not meant to be. But if you need boots on a station or a hostile ship, she'll get them there - and bring them home.

That became a problem during the push on Athebyne's outer stations.

We had the Milwaukee - an Errakis - assigned to screen the Io's carrier group. Standard formation, textbook deployment. Then the carrier's sensor array took a hit from long-range fire. Partial failure - enough to scramble targeting data, not enough to justify pulling back.

The Milwaukee was supposed to provide missile support. But with the carrier's sensors degraded and her own array already limited, she couldn't get a clean firing solution on anything beyond visual range. Captain N. Holt - good officer, Kori Naval Academy - had a ship full of ordnance and nothing to shoot at.

So he did what the ship was designed to do: he moved in close. Uncomfortably close. Within thirty thousand klicks of the enemy screen, using the carrier's fighters for targeting data and firing on delayed telemetry.

It worked. Barely. The Milwaukee took more hits in that engagement than any other ship in the group. Lost two crew compartments, vented half her missile reserves in an ammunition fire. But the carrier stayed operational, and the screen held.

Holt put in a formal complaint about the sensor limitations afterward. Command filed it. Nothing changed.

The Errakis does what she's built for. Just don't expect her to do it elegantly.""

Six months into the war, we had four Juzas in active service. The Jericho was flagship for the third battle group - my XO's command. Fleet engagement near Athebyne's inner belt. Standard line battle, cruiser-on-cruiser.

Then the Jericho's flux regulators spiked. Total system failure - her shields dropped, her weapons went cold. She was a two-hundred-thousand-tonne paperweight in the middle of a firing line.

Her chief engineer - man named Kovar, stubborn bastard - he rerouted power through the secondary grid, bypassed the safeties, and brought the flux system back online in under three minutes. Three minutes. Do you know what a miracle that is?

By the time the Jericho came back, she'd taken fourteen direct hits. Her armour held. Barely. Kovar kept her running for another six hours before the system burned out for good. We won that engagement.

During the final assault on Athebyne's capital shipyards, we had three Alwaids in the fleet. Heaven's Axiom, the Diligence, and the Eternity. The plan was simple: jump in, launch fighters, establish orbital superiority. Textbook carrier doctrine.

The first two battlegroups jumped on schedule. The Eternity's group? Delayed. Drive malfunction - forty minutes late to the fight.

By the time they arrived, we'd lost Heaven's Axiom and half her escort. The Diligence was burning, venting atmosphere from six hull breaches. We were fifteen minutes from a full retreat.

Then the Eternity translated in-system. Two hundred and forty fighters. Every torpedo tube loaded. She didn't win the battle - but she ended it. The enemy scattered. We held the orbitals.

Commander McKinnon - captain of the Eternity - he spent the next month in disciplinary review. I made sure he walked out with a promotion instead. Sometimes arriving late means you arrive when it matters most.

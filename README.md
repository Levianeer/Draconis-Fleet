__Overview:__<br>
The Draconis Defence Alliance is a military junta risen from the ashes of civil war. They sell weapons to anyone with credits and maintain a powerful fleet for a faction of their size. Their motives remain unclear.

_// PERSONAL LOG // REDACTED // DDA COMMAND_

_Lost two freighters to smugglers last week. Ex-First Fleet, still using Alliance codes. Ring-Port's getting bold._

_Athebyne reconstruction is six months behind. Again. Can't keep the mining ops running, can't guarantee safe shipping, can't stop the civilians from leaving. Population won't stay above three million. Hard to blame them—planet's half-radioactive and the pirates hit every third convoy._

_August authorised Beta cores for the refineries without asking. Now we've got Hegemony inspectors circling Kori and Itoron's assembly, screaming about sanctions. He says we need the production capacity. He's right, but that won't matter when an inspection fleet shows up._

_Everything runs through Itoron now. Athebyne can't feed itself, Kori bleeds credits on resupply, and we're haemorrhaging resources on convoy escorts. Tri-Tachyon—same bastards who armed both sides during the war—keeps offering to "fix" our logistics, for a price._

_Lost another Alruba to reactor failure yesterday. Third one this month. It turns out that reverse-engineered systems and captured components don't age well. We're cannibalising the old gunships for parts because nobody wants to admit they're obsolete._

_August says we're "building something that lasts." Right now, it feels like we're holding a station together with duct tape while the sector waits to see if we collapse on our own._

__Overview:__
_A fractured military coalition born from the ashes of the Fafnir Civil War. Its ships are fast, missile-focused, and built with wartime necessity in mind—often stripped-down, repurposed, or barely held together. Led by the divisive Admiral August, the Alliance is held together more by force than trust. Political decay, field improvisation, and the ghosts of a brutal past define a fleet that's effective, but brittle. Some vessels defy classification entirely. Most just carry the weight of too many compromises._
